# Future-Journal
This is my for-the-future journal, hopefully left for countless trillions of intelligent entities in the future.


## For the future
I've been thinking about this a lot recently. We think the 7.7 billion people on Earth/Tellus right now is a lot, and for us I guess it is, but thinking about the countless entities with intelligence bound to exist in the future, even if we assume we never find any intelligent life out there, 7.7 billion is but a drop in the ocean. I genuinely believe we are in the unique position of the first generations to have our entire informational footprint preserved for a possibly **very** long time, which is DOPE! 

Of course records from what we consider history will be preserved as well, but it will be akin to what mythology is to us in it's validability, while our every digital footprint can be preserved and kept for centuries to come (unless we all die). 

So I thought I'd make a kind of journal aimed at all the future generations, human or not. If for no one else, this is for any future being that finds this kind of thing interesting. I personally would have loved to read the diaries of someone who lived 2000 years ago. Not sure where this will go, how  introspective/raw/personal I'm willing to go with a journal published in such a public forum, just know I'm writing this knowing it is 100% public -- I'm sure that will affect what I write. 

It's a bit dizzying thinking about the concept that this might reach thousands, millions, billions of people in the future -- but also exciting in a way.

## Scope

Think about it. We are some of the first people to start adding to the permanent record of the Internet. Whether the internet is permanent or not is debatable, but I'm sure we will not only thin of a way to make it more permanent, but also to port old records to whatever new format we concieve. This is a "just in case" kind of arrangement, because hey why not! Hopefully a lot more people also come up with this idea, or already have. 

It's a bit of a shame that I just missed the github arctic project, but hey they might do it again. 

Assuming we humans start colonizing outer space eventually, and the population skyrockets, even if this reaches just a small fraction of the future population of intellectual beings - that could be billions of people! And this from the some of the first generations to experience the internet, a concept I'm sure will evolve and grow along with us as humans. I am in no way a representative of humanity, but just a infinitesimally small part of humanity that decided to document. 

## Structure
Eventually I might start organizing this thing, perhaps with folders representing categories, but I will always have a kind of semi-constant daily/weekly log that will just be a stream-of-consciousness snapshot of my current life. Expect it to be a incoherent mess, getting weirdly introspective at times. This will probably be the meat and bones of the Future Journal (lame name I know, but it's to the point!). 


If for nothing else, this is an interesting concept hopefully evoking the imagination of others stumbling upon this. Just remember -- this is meant to age like fine wine. Opening it up now will just get you a handful of wet grapes.
